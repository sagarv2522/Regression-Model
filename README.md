# Simple Linear Regression Estimate sales Model ðŸ¤–

*  Simple linear regression is a way to model the relationship between two variables. By assessing the direction and magnitude of a relationship, data professionals are able to uncover patterns and transform large amounts of data into valuable knowledge. This enables them to make better predictions and decisions.

*  The dataset provided includes information about marketing campaigns across TV, radio, and social media, as well as how much revenue in sales was generated from these campaigns. Based on this information, company leaders will make decisions about where to focus future marketing resources. Therefore, it is critical to provide them with a clear understanding of the relationship between types of marketing campaigns and the revenue generated as a result of this investment.
